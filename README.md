## Changelog / History / Release Notes

Check out [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/unplugstudio/mezzanine-seminars/releases).

## Installation

1. Install via pip: `pip install mezzanine-seminars`.
2. Add `"mezzanine_seminars"` to `INSTALLED_APPS`. Make sure `"mezzanine.accounts"` is also added.
3. Add to your root `urls.py`:

```python
url("^seminars/", include("mezzanine_seminars.urls", namespace="seminars"))
```

4. A new Seminars section will appear in the admin. Create your first Seminar!
5. Point your visitors to `/seminars/` to see the list of available seminars.

## Accepting payments

By default registering for a Seminar is completely free even if the seminar has a set price. You can enforce a payment requirement by using a custom form in `settings.SEMINARS_REGISTRATION_FORM` . Different payment processors require different forms:

### Stripe

First, make sure you install the additional requirements with `pip install mezzanine-seminars[stripe]`. Then make sure you define your secret API key in `settings.STRIPE_SK`. In development this should be a test key.

Finally set the Stripe form to be used when users register for a seminar:

```python
# settings.py
SEMINARS_REGISTRATION_FORM = "mezzanine_seminars.forms.stripe.StripeRegistrationForm"
```

This will handle the backend configuration, but you will need to override `seminars/seminar_registration_create.html` to configure Stripe's browser bindings `stripe.js`. This is explained in [Stripe's official docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment-synchronously), but it boils down to sending a PaymentMethod ID in the hidden field named `stripe_method`. With that the server will be able to complete the purchase.
